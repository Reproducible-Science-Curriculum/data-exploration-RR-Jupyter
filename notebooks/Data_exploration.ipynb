    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project. Once a library is imported, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn’t load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to add an import statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`. An example of importing the Pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.\n",

    "matplotlib is the most widely used Python library for plotting.  We can run it in the notebook using the magic command `%matplotlib inline`. If you do not use `%matplotlib inline`, your plots will be generated outside of the notebook and may be difficult to find.  See [the IPython docs](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html) for other IPython magics commands.\n",

There is a whole range of graphics packages in Python, ranging from basic visualizations to fancy, interactive graphics like [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).  \n",

'NaN' or 'null' does not mean the value at that position is zero, it means that there is no information at that position. Ignoring missing data doesn't make it go away. There are different ways of dealing with it which include:\n",

    "* analyzing only the available data (i.e. ignore the missing data)\n",
    "* input the missing data with replacement values and treating these as though they were observed\n",

    "* use statistical models to allow for missing data--make assumptions about their relationships with the available data as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes with the dirty gapminder data set, we know our missing data is excess (and unnecessary) and we are going to choose to analyze only the available data. To do this, we will simply remove rows with missing values.\n",

Many of the steps we've shown are aimed at uncovering interesting or problematic things in the dataset that are not immediately obvious.  We want to stress that when you're doing EDA, it will not necessarily be a linear workflow like what we have shown.  When you plot or summarize your data, you may uncover new issues: for example, we saw this when we made a mistake fixing the naming conventions for the Democratic Republic of Congo.  You might discover outliers, unusually large values, or points that don't make sense in your plots.
