    "* Describe findings, translate results from code to text using Markdown comments in the Jupyter Notebook, summarizing your thought process in a narrative.\n",
    "* Modify raw data to prepare a clean data set -- including copying data, removing or replacing missing and incoherent data, dropping columns, removing duplicates.\n",
    "* Assess whether data is “Tidy” and identify appropriate steps and write and  execute code to arrange it into a tidy format - including merging, reshaping, subsetting, grouping, sorting, and making appropriate new columns.\n",
    "* Identify several relevant summary measures.\n",
    "* Illustrate data in plots and determine the need for repeated or further analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project. Once a library is imported, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn’t load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to add an import statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`. An example of importing the Pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`import`** `pandas` **`as`** `pd`\n",
    "\n",
    "## matplotlib and other plotting libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib is the most widely used Python library for plotting.  We can run it in the notebook using the magic command `%matplotlib inline`. If you do not use `%matplotlib inline`, your plots will be generated outside of the notebook and may be difficult to find.  See [the IPython docs](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html) for other IPython magics commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will only use matplotlib and Seaborn, another package that works in tandem with matplotlib to make nice graphics.  There is a whole range of graphics packages in Python, ranging from basic visualizations to fancy, interactive graphics like [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to explore on your own!  Chances are, if you can imagine a plot you'd like to make, somebody else has written a package to do it.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is the Python Data Analysis Library (a.k.a. Pandas). The Pandas library is built on top of the NumPy package (another Python library). Pandas provides data structures, produces high quality plots with matplotlib, and integrates nicely with other libraries that use NumPy arrays. Those familiar with spreadsheets should become comfortable with Pandas data structures."

Calling `dataset.head()` will display the first 5 rows of the data.  You can specify how many rows you want to see as an argument, like `dataset.head(10)`.

    "Before we get started with cleaning our data, let's practice good data hygiene by first creating a copy of our original data set. Often, you want to leave the original data untouched.  To protect your original, you can make a copy of your data (and save it to a new `DataFrame` variable) before operating on the data or a subset of the data.  This will ensure that a new version of the original data is created and your original is preserved.\n",

    "Suppose you take a subset of your `DataFrame` and store it in a new variable, like `gapminder_early = gapminder[gapminder['year'] < 1970]`.  Doing this does not actually create a new object. Instead, you have just given a name to that subset of the original data: `gapminder_early`. This subset still points to the original rows of `gapminder`.  Any changes you make to the new `DataFrame` `gapminder_early` will appear in the corresponding rows of your original `gapminder` `DataFrame` too.  \n"

    "## Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data (often denoted as 'NaN'- not a number- in Pandas, or as 'null') is an important issue to handle because Pandas cannot compute on rows or columns with missing data. 'NaN' or 'null' does not mean the value at that position is zero, it means that there is no information at that position. Ignoring missing data doesn't make it go away. There are different ways of dealing with it which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* analyzing only the available data (i.e. ignore the missing data)\n",
    "* input the missing data with replacement values and treating these as though they were observed\n",
    "* input the missing data and account for the fact that these were inputed with uncertainty (ex: create a new boolean variable so you know that these values were not actually observed)\n",
    "* use statistical models to allow for missing data--make assumptions about their relationships with the available data as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes with the dirty gapminder data set, we know our missing data is excess (and unnecessary) and we are going to choose to analyze only the available data. To do this, we will simply remove rows with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incredibly easy to do because Pandas allows you to either remove all instances with null data or replace them with a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`df = df.dropna()` drops rows with any column having NA/null data.  `df = df.fillna(value)` replaces all NA/null data with the argument `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more fine-grained control of which rows (or columns) to drop, you can use `how` or `thresh`. These are more advanced topics and are not covered in this lesson; you are encouraged to explore them on your own."

    "A regular expression, a.k.a. regex, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. In a regular expression, the symbol “*” matches the preceding character 0 or more times, whereas “+” matches the preceding character 1 or more times. “.” matches any single character. Writing “x|y” means to match either ‘x’ or ‘y’.\n",

    "Pandas allows you to use `regex` in its `replace()` function -- when a regex term is found in an element, the element is then replaced with the specified replacement term. In order for it to appropriately correct elements, both regex and inplace variables need to be set to `True` (as their defaults are False). This ensures that the initial input string is read as a regular expression and that the elements will be modified in place.\n",

Unfortunately, this creates 24 instances of the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- this is an error in our cleaning! We can revert back to the non-temporary `DataFrame` and correctly modify our regex to isolate only the Democratic Republic instances (as opposed to including the Republic as well)."

    "In this lesson, we've taken the raw data and worked through steps to prepare it for analysis, but we have not yet done any \"data analysis\".  This part of the data workflow can be thought of as \"exploratory data analysis\", or EDA.  Many of the steps we've shown are aimed at uncovering interesting or problematic things in the dataset that are not immediately obvious.  We want to stress that when you're doing EDA, it will not necessarily be a linear workflow like what we have shown.  When you plot or summarize your data, you may uncover new issues: for example, we saw this when we made a mistake fixing the naming conventions for the Democratic Republic of Congo.  You might discover outliers, unusually large values, or points that don't make sense in your plots.  Clearly, the work here isn't done: you'll have to investigate these points, decide how to fix any potential problems, document the reasoning for your actions, and check that your fix actually worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, plots and summaries might reveal interesting questions about your data.  You may return to the cleaning and prepping steps in order to dig deeper into these questions.  You should continuously refine your plots to give the clearest picture of your hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting findings\n",

    "This should be particular to the dataset at hand.  Need to build upon results from the previous section.\n"
