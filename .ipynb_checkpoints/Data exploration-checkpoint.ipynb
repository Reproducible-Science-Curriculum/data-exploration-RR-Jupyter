    "## About Libraries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project. Once a library is imported, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn’t load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to add an import statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`. An example of importing the Pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`import`** `pandas` **`as`** `pd`\n",
    "\n",
    "## matplotlib and other plotting libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib is the most widely used Python library for plotting.  We can run it in the notebook using the magic command `%matplotlib inline`. If you do not use `%matplotlib inline`, your plots will be generated outside of the notebook and may be difficult to find.  See [the docs](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html) for other options to pass to the magic command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will only use matplotlib and seaborn, another package that works in tandem with matplotlib to make nice graphics.  There is a whole range of graphics packages in Python, ranging from basic visualizations to fancy, interactive graphics like [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to explore on your own!  Chances are, if you can imagine a plot you'd like to make, somebody else has written a package to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pandas Library\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the Python Data Analysis Library (a.k.a. Pandas). The Pandas library is built on top of the NumPy package (another Python library). Pandas provides data structures, produces high quality plots with matplotlib, and integrates nicely with other libraries that use NumPy arrays."

    "## What’s a DataFrame?\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store in columns data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more). It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table or the data.frame in R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of an element in the data structure.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing to do when loading data into the notebook is to actually \"look\" at it.  How many rows and columns are there?  What types of variables are in it and what values can they take?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are usually too many rows to print to the screen.  By default, when you type the name of the dataframe and run a cell, Pandas knows to not print the whole thing.  Instead, you will see the first and last few rows with dots in between.  A neater way to view a preview of the dataset is the `head()` method.  Calling `dataset.head()` will display the first 5 rows of the data.  You can specify how many rows you want to see as an argument, like `dataset.head(10)`.  The `tail()` method does the same with the last rows of the dataframe."

    "In this lesson, we've taken the raw data and worked through steps to prepare it for analysis, but we have not yet done any \"data analysis\".  This part of the data workflow can be thought of as \"exploratory data analysis\", or EDA.  Many of the steps we've shown are aimed at uncovering interesting or problematic things in the dataset that are not immediately obvious.  We want to stress that when you're doing EDA, it will not necessarily be a linear workflow like what we have shown.  When you plot or summarize your data, you may uncover new issues: for example, we saw this when we made a mistake fixing the naming conventions for the Democratic Republic of Congo.  You might discover outliers, unusually large values, or points that don't make sense in your plots.  Clearly, the work here isn't done: you'll have to investigate these points, decide how to fix any potential problems, document the reasoning for your actions, and check that your fix actually worked.\n",

    "On the other hand, plots and summaries might reveal interesting questions about your data.  You may return to the cleaning and prepping steps in order to dig deeper into these questions.  You should continuously refine your plots to give the clearest picture of your hypotheses.\n",
